# :wave: Hi, I’m Angela Carraro

I'm an enthusiastic learner with a passion for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics (with a focus on Computer Science), and a Master’s Degree in Data Science and Scientific Computing, which felt as the natural combination of my interests. 

I have worked on several Machine Learning projects, available on GitHub, mainly in Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning topics, one also developed in a HPC environment. I've done also two projects in software development: one in C++ using TravisCI for continuous integration and one in Java using Gradle and agile programming techniques. My main programming language is Python.

## :card_index_dividers: Projects

* Achieved an initial average of 12 points out of 448 (which would increase with more time and more cluster resources) in the game “Breakout” using Double (Deep) Q-Learning. [GitHub](https://github.com/AngieC96/ReinforcementLProject)

* Analyzed and forecasted the evolution of the Covid-19 outbreak in central Colombia in R using different Statistical Methods: Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Bayesian models. [GitHub](https://github.com/GaiaSaveri/SMDS-project)

* Implementation and testing of a Binary Search Tree in C++, which is about 15% faster than std::map, depending on the operating system. [GitHub](https://github.com/matteosecli/AP_BST)

* Development of the game "Dots and boxes" and an intelligent player which learns how to play using Reinforcement Learning. [GitHub](https://github.com/andygaspar/d-bSML)

* A review of the literature concerning Graph Neural Networks for the course of "Deep Learning". [GitHub](https://github.com/AngieC96/DeepLearningProject)
